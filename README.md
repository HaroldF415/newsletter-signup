## Description

This project was created to help us learn APIs. In this particular case we are using MailChimp's API to create a newsletter signup page. This page will allow the user to input their name and e-mail address which will then be sent over to MailChimp for us take hold of that data.

### Issues

There are still issues with this project which will be dealt with promptly. As of 8/5/2020 I'm still documenting my projects. This is the first project that I will come back to and fix the errors that are presented.
